- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Audebert96Adamo

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML / CSS / Javascript and PHP.

- You can find 2 types of repository on my github : project and model 

- Project : these are created by me and their purpose is to summarize all the knowledge that I've acquired until now.

- Model : these are created by some content creator who shares on Youtube or Github their knowledges for example Fromscratch, I only follow their instructions and try to replicate their result with my own code 

<!---
Audebert96Adamo/Audebert96Adamo is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
